# Dotfiles!

Customizations for my bash environment. Feel free to crib from it, but I highly
suggest you start your own from scratch. For instance, you might try [this
super basic
`.vimrc`](http://vimuniversity.com/samples/your-first-vimrc-should-be-nearly-empty).

The repo is structured to play nicely with
[homesick](http://rubygems.org/gems/homesick).

## Homesicking It Up

To symlink new files:

```
$ homesick symlink benhamill/dotfiles
```
